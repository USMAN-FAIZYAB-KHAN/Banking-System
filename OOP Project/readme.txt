, you can install django and run the server directly by running the runserver.py file. We recommend you to use internet
when running this project for better functionality.

is stored in our project can be seen in the model.py file in banking_site directory

5. The remaining python files are related to Django

6. The static folder consists of images used in the interface. 

7. The html files in templates folder make up the interface of our project
